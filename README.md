# Malaria-Cell-Image-Dataset
  

Using a convolutional neural network from Keras to classify cells by their presence of malaria.
  
My goal for this project was to learn Keras and TensorFlow. I used the tutorials on the TensorFlow [website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) and was interested in the difference in performance bewteen GPU and CPU.
